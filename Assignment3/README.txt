I have made a jar file for easy execution of my source code. The cmd is 
java -jar hw3 input.txt output.txt
Please provide 2 input parameters. "Input FileName" and "OutputFileName"
The src folder has all the source code. 

If the number of guests are 0 or number of tables are 0 I return not satisfiable !! This is an assumption as these test casaes are just boundary tc and dont make sense

Currently my machine can only test 2 tables and then the JVM runs out of memory.

Java 7 Used

IDE is eclipse.
