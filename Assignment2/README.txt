I have made a jar file for easy execution of my source code. The cmd is 
java -jar hw2 input.txt output.txt
Please provide 2 input parameters. "Input FileName" and "OutputFileName"
The src folder has all the source code. 
I have the following classes.

Node
ConnectFour (main class)
GameBoard
AlphaBetaPruning

The input file must have the correct format, Node names first and then the adjacency matrix.

Java 7 Used

IDE is eclipse.

Maximising Player is always 'a'
Minimizing Player is always 'b'

If the input has a winner or a draw, output is taken care accordingly.
