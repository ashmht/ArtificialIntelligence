I have made a jar file for easy execution of my source code. The cmd is 
java -jar CSCI561Assignment1 "inputfilename"
This generates a output.txt file in the folder of SocialNetwork.java which has
the results BFS, DFS and UCS.
Note the input file must be in the same folder as the SocialNetwork.java folder.
The src folder has all the source code. 
I have the following classes.
Node
SocialNetwork (main class)
BFS
DFS
UCS

The input file must have the correct format, Node names first and then the adjacency matrix.

Java 7 Used

IDE is eclipse.

If there are errors, a file called Error.txt will be generated with appropriate error information

Source Node is hard coded to Alice and Goal Node is Noah
